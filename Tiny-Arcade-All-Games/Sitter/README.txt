RULES
 - Carry the children to the goal and don't let them die.
 - Level ends if the hero is dead.
 - Level ends if every living human is on the goal.
 - Standing on something on the goal counts as on goal.
 - If everyone is alive at the end, you win!

CONTROLS
 - Left/right to walk.
 - Right button to jump.
 - Left button to pick up or toss.
 - Jump, Pickup, and Toss are also influenced by the stick.
 
If a level becomes impossible and you can't get killed either, wait for 15 seconds.

There are 26 levels.
Game keeps track of your time -- playing time only, splash screens don't count.
To erase all your recorded times, delete the file "hiscores".

DRAMATIS PERSONAE
 - You are Bonnie, the brave babysitter.
 - The boy Desmond is always happy, he never moves on his own.
 - The girl Susie is rambunctious. She won't stop moving unless something blocks her.

TIPS
 - Nothing is random. If a move works once, it should work every time.
 - Use Down+Toss to place the children carefully.
 - Be mindful of the direction Susie is facing; she'll continue moving in that direction when you let go.
 - Susie stop briefly when blocked. At the end of that delay, she'll proceed in the same direction if unblocked.
 - Vegetables don't count as children.
